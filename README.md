# html-css

This repository contains the HTML and CSS files for the Sinister Cut website,
which is a fictional barbershop catering to supernatural creatures
such as vampires, werewolves, witches, and zombies.

The purpose of this project was to experiment with the basics of HTML and CSS,
based on Alura course.
